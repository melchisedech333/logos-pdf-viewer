This is a software made in Javascript and Electron, and its intention is to be a PDF reader with the option to translate parts of the text.

The idea is very simple, I select the text, and when I release the mouse button, it immediately opens a window with the selected text being translated in Google Translate.

To use the application, just download the repository, access it and run <b>electron</b>, passing the directory in question as a parameter.

```bash
electron .
```

The Electron version used in the tests is 19.0.0, and you can download it here: https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v19.0.0
